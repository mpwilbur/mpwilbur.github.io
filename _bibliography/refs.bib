  abstract     = {Residents in cities typically use third-party platforms such as Google Maps for route planning services. While providing near real-time processing, these state of the art centralized deployments are limited to multiprocessing environments in data centers. This raises privacy concerns, increases risk for critical data and causes vulnerability to network failure. In this paper, we propose to use decentralized road side units (RSU) (owned by the city) to perform route planning. We divide the city road network into grids, each assigned an RSU where traffic data is kept locally, increasing security and resiliency such that the system can perform even if some RSUs fail. Route generation is done in two steps. First, an optimal grid sequence is generated, prioritizing shortest path calculation accuracy but not RSU load. Second, we assign route planning tasks to the grids in the sequence. Keeping in mind RSU load and constraints, tasks can be allocated and executed in any non-optimal grid but with lower accuracy. We evaluate this system using Metropolitan Nashville road traffic data. We divided the area into 500 grids, configuring load and neighborhood sizes to meet delay constraints while maximizing model accuracy. The results show that there is a 30 percent decrease in processing time with a decrease in model accuracy of 99 percent to 92.3 percent, by simply increasing the search area to the optimal grid{\textquoteright}s immediate neighborhood.},

driven rapid development in data-intensive smart city applications

scalability. This has resulted in efficient centralized route planning
services such as Google Maps, upon which millions of

with the cloud environments in which they run. Current state
of the art solutions assume a shared memory model, hence
deployment is limited to multiprocessing environments in data

limiting parameter in the technologies of the future, such as
autonomous cars. Additionally, these services require access
to outside networks, raising availability concerns in disaster
scenarios. Therefore, this paper provides a decentralized route
planning approach for private fog networks. We leverage recent
advances in federated learning to collaboratively learn shared

  abstract      = {Public transit can have significantly lower environmental impact than personal vehicles; however, it still uses a substantial amount of energy, causing air pollution and greenhouse gas emission. While electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce energy use, most public transit agencies have to employ them in combination with conventional, internal-combustion engine vehicles due to the high upfront costs of EVs. To make the best use of such a mixed fleet of vehicles, transit agencies need to optimize route assignments and charging schedules, which presents a challenging problem for large public transit networks. We introduce a novel problem formulation to minimize fuel and electricity use by assigning vehicles to transit trips and scheduling them for charging while serving an existing fixed-route transit schedule. We present an integer program for optimal discrete-time scheduling, and we propose polynomial-time heuristic algorithms and a genetic algorithm for finding solutions for larger networks. We evaluate our algorithms on the transit service of a mid-size U.S. city using operational data collected from public transit vehicles. Our results show that the proposed algorithms are scalable and achieve near-minimum energy use.},

  year          = {2020},
  abstract      = {Public transit is central to cultivating equitable communities. Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 and associated social restrictions has radically transformed ridership behavior in urban areas. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is that low-income and historically marginalized groups are not only the most susceptible to economic shifts but are also most reliant on public transportation. As revenue decreases, transit agencies are tasked with providing adequate public transportation services in an increasingly hostile economic environment. Transit agencies therefore have two primary concerns. First, how has COVID-19 impacted ridership and what is the new post-COVID normal? Second, how has ridership varied spatio-temporally and between socio-economic groups? In this work we provide a data-driven analysis of COVID-19's affect on public transit operations and identify temporal variation in ridership change. We then combine spatial distributions of ridership decline with local economic data to identify variation between socio-economic groups. We find that in Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, fixed-line bus ridership dropped by 66.9\% and 65.1\% from 2019 baselines before stabilizing at 48.4% and 42.8% declines respectively. The largest declines were during morning and evening commute time. Additionally, there was a significant difference in ridership decline between the highest-income areas and lowest-income areas (77\% vs 58\%) in Nashville.},

  abstract  = {Proliferation of shared urban mobility devices (SUMDs), particularly dockless e-scooters, has created opportunities for users with efficient, short trips, but raised management challenges for cities and regulators in terms of safety, infrastructure, and parking. There is a need in some high-demand areas for dedicated parking locations for dockless e-scooters and other devices. We propose the use of data generated by SUMD trips for establishing locations of parking facilities and assessing their required capacity and anticipated utilization. The problem objective is: find locations for a given number of parking facilities that maximize the number of trips that could reasonably be ended and parked at these facilities. Posed another way, what is the minimum number and best locations of parking facilities needed to cover a desired portion of trips at these facilities? In order to determine parking locations, areas of high-density trip destination points are found using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The dwell time of each device is used to estimate the number of devices parked in a location over time and the necessary capacity of the parking facility. The methodology is tested on a dataset of approximately 100,000 e-scooter trips at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. We find DBSCAN to be the most effective algorithm at determining high-performing parking locations. A selection of 19 parking locations, is enough to capture roughly 25 percent of all trips in the dataset. The vast majority of parking facilities found require a mean capacity of 6 scooters when sized for the 98th percentile observed demand.},

ABSTRACT="Due to increasing concerns about environmental impact, operating costs, and
energy security, public transit agencies are seeking to reduce their fuel
use by employing electric vehicles (EVs). However, because of the high
upfront cost of EVs, most agencies can afford only mixed fleets of
internal-combustion and electric vehicles. Making the best use of these
mixed fleets presents a challenge for agencies since optimizing the
assignment of vehicles to transit routes, scheduling charging, etc. require
accurate predictions of electricity and fuel use. Recent advances in
sensor-based technologies, data analytics, and machine learning enable
remedying this situation; however, to the best of our knowledge, there
exists no framework that would integrate all relevant data into a
route-level prediction model for public transit. In this paper, we present
a novel framework for the data-driven prediction of route-level energy use
for mixed-vehicle transit fleets, which we evaluate using data collected
from the bus fleet of CARTA, the public transit authority of Chattanooga,
TN. We present a data collection and storage framework, which we use to
capture system-level data, including traffic and weather conditions, and
high-frequency vehicle-level data, including location traces, fuel or
electricity use, etc. We present domain-specific methods and algorithms for
integrating and cleansing data from various sources, including street and
elevation maps. Finally, we train and evaluate machine learning models,
including deep neural networks, decision trees, and linear regression, on
our integrated dataset. Our results show that neural networks provide
accurate estimates, while other models can help us discover relations
between energy use and factors such as road and weather conditions."

  ABSTRACT="Taxi fleets serve a significant and important subset of travel demand
  in major cities around the world. This paper characterizes the Chicago taxi fleet
  operational network using complex network metrics and analyzes the operational
  efficiency of individual taxis over the past four years using an extensive taxi-trip
  dataset. The dataset, recently released by the city of Chicago, includes the pickup
  and drop-off census tracts and time stamps for over 100 million taxi trips. The paper
  explores year-over-year changes in the spatial distribution of Chicago taxi travel
  demand. The taxi pickup and drop-off census tract locations are modeled as nodes,
  and links are generated between unique pickup and drop-off node pairs. The analysis
  shows that high-demand pickup and drop-off location pairs in 2013 generated similar
  trip volumes in 2016; however, the low-demand pairs in 2013 generated significantly
  fewer trips in 2016. Additionally, this paper presents temporal efficiency and spatial
  efficiency metrics. The temporal efficiency metric determines the percentage of
  in-service time taxis are productive (i.e., transporting travelers), rather than empty.
  The spatial efficiency metric measures the percentage of taxi miles that are
  productive (i.e., loaded), rather than empty. The efficiency analysis of the Chicago
  taxi fleet shows that, for most taxis, around 50% of their in-service time and travel
  distance are unproductive. This inefficiency negatively affects the profitability of
  individual drivers and the fleet, traffic congestion, vehicle emissions, the service
  quality provided to customers, and the ability of taxi services to compete with
  emerging mobility services."

  ABSTRACT="Internet of Things (IoT), edge/fog computing, and
            the cloud are fueling rapid development in smart connected
            cities. Given the increasing rate of urbanization, the advancement
            of these technologies is a critical component of mitigating
            demand on already constrained transportation resources. Smart
            transportation systems are most effectively implemented as a
            decentralized network, in which traffic sensors send data to small
            low-powered devices called Roadside Units (RSUs). These RSUs
            host various computation and networking services. Data driven
            applications such as optimal routing require precise real-time
            data, however, data-driven approaches are susceptible to data
            integrity attacks. Therefore we propose a multi-tiered anomaly
            detection framework which utilizes spare processing capabilities
            of the distributed RSU network in combination with the cloud for
            fast, real-time detection. In this paper we present a novel real
            time anomaly detection framework. Additionally, we focus on
            implementation of our framework in smart-city transportation
            systems by providing a constrained clustering algorithm for
            RSU placement throughout the network. Extensive experimental
            validation using traffic data from Nashville, TN demonstrates
            that the proposed methods significantly reduce computation
            requirements while maintaining similar perfomance to current
            state of the art anomaly detection methods."

            these have addressed some flaws of cloud computing some
            challenges remain particularly in terms of privacy and security.
            We create a testbed based on a distributed processing platform

            briefly describe a decentralized traffic speed query and routing
