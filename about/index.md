# Biography

I am a 3rd year PhD student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. I work in the SCOPE ([Smart
and Resilient Computing for Physical Environments](https://scopelab.ai/)) Lab which is managed by my advisor
Professor Abhishek Dubey, PhD and is affiliated with the Institute for Software Integrated Systems. 
My work is focused on designing efficient and equitable transit systems by using artificial intelligence 
and large-scale real-time data analysis. Most of my work is partnered with the transit agencies of
Chattanooga and Nashville Tennessee. For a comprehensive overview of our groups work with smart
transit systems check out [smarttransit.ai](https://smarttransit.ai/).

I earned my M.S. degree in civil engineering from Northwestern University where I worked in the
Northwestern University Transportation Center (NUTC) and I earned my B.S. in civil engineering
at the University of Notre Dame. Between my undergraduate studies and masters, I worked 
for four years at Johnson Wilbur Adams, Inc., a structural engineering firm in the 
Chicago-area where I performed modeling and analysis for structures throughout the U.S. 

I grew up in the western suburbs of Chicago with my parents and two brothers,
and now live in Nashville with my wife Catherine. Outside of work I enjoy golfing, zip-lining, 
playing the guitar and cheering on ND football on Saturdays.
