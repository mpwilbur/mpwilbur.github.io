This website is built with GitHub Pages and Jekyll. There are two sources that deserve credit for the template design
of this site. For the site I used [William Barbour's](https://barbourww.github.io/) derivative of 
[Michael Rose's](https://mademistakes.com) `hpstr-jekyll-theme`. Michael Rose's template is available 
on [his Github](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme).

For A detailed set of instructions on using these materials see William Barbour's [theme-setup](https://barbourww.github.io//theme-setup/).
Please make sure to give credit to Michael Rose (the original template) and if using my derivative, William Barbour as well.
